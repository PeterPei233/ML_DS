Mainly tools or frameworks : Python, Jupyter Notebook, SKLearn, Pandas, Pytorch, openCV, Machine Learning and Data Analysis

## 1. Analyse Trump's Twitter

- Access the recent 3 years' Trump's Twitts var Twitter API
- analyse Trump's twitting behaviour
- try to predict Trump's sentiment by his twitts.

## 2. Predict New-York Taxi drivers' duration

#### 2.1 Data Wrapping: 
- Querying for data from a database using SQL
- Basic data cleaning using SQL and Pandas

#### 2.2 EDA , Visualization, Feature Engineering 
- Exploratory data analysis of the NYC Taxi dataset
- Generate visualizations to gain insight on the dataset

#### 2.3 External Datasets
- Exploratory data analysis of the NYC accidents dataset
- Join the taxi dataset with NYC accidents dataset, make connection and observation

#### 2.4 Feature Engineering and Model Fitting 
- Feature engineering based on gained insights
- Modeling with sklearn data pipelines
- Submission to Kaggle and rank top5% [https://www.kaggle.com/c/ds100-fa18-proj2/leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ds100-fa18-proj2/leaderboard)

## 3. Image Classification

- input DataSet: around 2000 images in 20 different categories. 
- After Data Cleaning, EDA, visualization and feature engineering, we create a feature matrix with around 20 scalar features with SK-Learn, OpenCV. 
- Trained the training matrix with Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, SVM and Random Forest. And got the best accuracy (43.9%)with Random Forest.
- Implemented Image Classification with a popular deep learning model ResNet-18 in PyTorch and improve the accuracy largely.
